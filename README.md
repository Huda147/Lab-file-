## 📖 Overview

This lab project file is for machine learning for beginners course.

---

## 🗂 Dataset

- The dataset should be placed in the parent folder.
- All the dataset is placed in Dataset folder.

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model is built and trained with:
- **Image Augmentation:** Rescale, shear, zoom, horizontal flip
- **Model Type:** Sequential CNN
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Metrics:** Accuracy

All training logic and architecture details are available in the Jupyter notebook.
